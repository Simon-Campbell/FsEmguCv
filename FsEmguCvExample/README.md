Getting Started with F# and OpenCV========================I am using Windows 10 Pro x64 so some dependencies may differ. Getting and Building Emgu CV----------------------------------1. Download and install **Visual Studio Community 2015** (already installed on my system)2.

Extract contents of libemgucv-windows-universal-3.0.0.2157.zip to a folder (replace with $EmgCVPath further down)	e.g. Extract to c:\emgucv-3.0\	5. Build solution "$EmgCVPath\Solution\VS2010-2015\Emgu.CV.sln" in Visual Studio Community 2015 in Release mode. This will produce binaries in *$EmguCVPath\bin*Creating a New Project with Build Artefacts -----------------------------------------------1. Create new F# library project using Visual Studio2. Right click references in project and click **Add Reference ...**3. Add Emgu.Util.dll and Emgu.CV.dll from **$EmgCVPath\bin**4.
